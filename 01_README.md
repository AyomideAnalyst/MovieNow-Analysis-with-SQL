For the purpose of this project, I set out to answer the following questions;

4. What is the average, minimum and maximum renting price of movies available on MovieNow?
5. What is the average renting price by genre and how it compares to the overall average renting price of $2.21?.
6. Does renting price affect how movies are rented?

#### _Does rating affect how movies are rented?_
7. What is the average, minimum and maximum rating of all movies?
8. Which movie title(s) has a rating of 1?
9. Which movies have a perfect rating of 10?
10. Identify the top 10 movies with the most rentals and their average rating.
11. Do movies with the rating score of 10 have more rentals?

#### _Who are the customers of MovieNow?_
12. Who are our customers and where do they come from?
13. If MovieNow decides to reward it highest paying customer. Who would that customer be and what country would that customer be residing?.
